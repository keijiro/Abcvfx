**Abcvfx** is a Unity sample project showing using VFX Graph with Alembic animation.

Previously, this repository contained a special package to support Alembic animation on VFX Graph.
This special package is no longer needed because VFX Graph accepts dynamic mesh input as a standard feature in the recent versions.
